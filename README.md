# Networkx-tutorial
This guide can help you start working with NetworkX.  NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

# NetworkX supports:

Data structures for graphs, digraphs, and multigraphs
Many standard graph algorithms
Network structure and analysis measures
Generators for classic graphs, random graphs, and synthetic networks
Nodes can be "anything" (e.g., text, images, XML records)
Edges can hold arbitrary data (e.g., weights, time-series)
networkX is open source
